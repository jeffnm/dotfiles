# dotfiles


## WORK IN PROGRESS - chezmoi configuration
I'm converting this repo to use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for dotfile management

### Status
#### Done
* helix/config.toml
* zshrc
* zimrc
* vimrc
* hypr/... 
* waybar
* wofi

#### Unmaintained
I kept a copy of my xmonad config in `xmonad/` since it was the config that hooked me on tiling window managers. Eventually I'll delete it since I'm not going back to x11 again if I can help it.

#### ToDo
* improve templating for different systems
* find other unmanaged configs that could/should be added from each system
